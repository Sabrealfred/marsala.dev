# From Spreadsheets to Living Dashboards in 21 Days

> My Mondays no longer start with copy/paste—every metric lives in a trustworthy board.

## Context

I inherited 14 spreadsheets with fragile macros. Instead of crying I turned them into reproducible pipelines and self-service panels.

## Stack I leaned on

- Supabase as staging DB
- BigQuery for consolidated facts
- dbt + Elementary for tests and alerts
- Metabase + Looker Studio for viz

## Playbook

1. Audited every spreadsheet and mapped owners, columns and definitions.
2. Built intermediate tables in dbt with schema + freshness tests.
3. Redesigned KPIs in Metabase with filterable narratives.
4. Automated PDF snapshots and Slack alerts for ±15% swings.
5. Trained the team on safe exploration using curated collections.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Hours spent on reporting: 24h/month → 3h/month
- Manual errors detected: ~10% → &lt;1%
- Time to answer CEO questions: 'tomorrow' → 'right now'

## What stuck with me

- Don't delete spreadsheets until the new layer has champions.
- Storytelling matters; each dashboard includes notes and FAQs.

## What I'm building next

I'm experimenting with interactive notebooks so product and growth build their own deep dives. Want a tour? schedule it on /contact.

# AI Lead Qualification Copilot

> I gave the sales team an assistant that thinks like we do, not like a bot.

## Context

I didn’t want another generic template. I trained a copilot on real deals, objections and CRM chaos so it responds the way I would.

## Stack I leaned on

- OpenAI GPT-4o mini + versioned prompts
- Airtable as an editable buffer
- Attio API to write notes and scores
- Cloud Run + Redis for snappy queues

## Playbook

1. Collected examples of good/bad emails and annotated them with context (ICP, stage, objections).
2. Built modular prompts with data from the warehouse and recent activity.
3. Added human-in-the-loop when the score crosses a threshold.
4. Synced outputs back to the CRM and triggered personalized follow-ups in Resend.
5. Held weekly retros with sales to tweak tone and fields.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Time to first reply: 3h → 90 seconds
- Sales acceptance rate: +34%
- Manual corrections: -62%

## What stuck with me

- The dataset dictates everything; without deal-desk context the model hallucinated optimism.
- Version prompts with change control; I store every edit in Git.

## What I'm building next

I'm experimenting with small models trained on closed-won/lost tickets. Want to co-build? DM me.

# Next.js Performance Audits Without the Drama

> Give me clear budgets over last-minute hacks any day.

## Context

I maintain landing pages and content-heavy apps. To avoid nuking Web Vitals I run frequent audits with repeatable processes.

## Stack I leaned on

- Lighthouse CI + GitHub Actions
- WebPageTest for real scenarios
- Calibre for continuous monitoring
- Next.js analyzer + bundle buddy

## Playbook

1. Define budgets (LCP, CLS, JS weight) and document them in the repo.
2. Run Lighthouse on every PR and block merges on regressions.
3. Use optimized images and streaming for heavy assets.
4. Review shared bundles and convert heavy libs into dynamic imports.
5. Share results weekly via a simple dashboard.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Average LCP: <2.2s desktop, <2.6s mobile
- JS shipped per page: -35%
- Post-release performance bugs: near zero

## What stuck with me

- Audits must live inside the sprint, not as an extra chore.
- Budgets only work if every squad knows them by heart.

## What I'm building next

I’m sharing a GitHub Actions workflow template with configurable budgets. Want it? let me know.

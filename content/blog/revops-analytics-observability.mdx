# Observability for RevOps Analytics

> I'd rather be the one telling sales about an incident, not the other way around.

## Context

Revenue lives and dies by clean metrics. I implemented observability so anomalies show up minutes—not hours—later.

## Stack I leaned on

- dbt Core + Elementary
- Metaplane listening to artifacts
- Notion + PagerDuty for runbooks
- Slack alerts with context

## Playbook

1. Tag critical tables (leads, pipeline, recognized revenue) and assign budgets.
2. Add freshness, volume and schema tests in dbt.
3. Let Metaplane learn expectations and reduce alert noise.
4. Automate incident tickets with n8n after two consecutive failures.
5. Publish pipeline-health dashboards so everyone sees the same truth.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Incidents detected before business notices: 35 minutes earlier
- Blocked launches from bad metrics: 0 in Q1
- Model ownership coverage: 3 engineers can maintain all tables

## What stuck with me

- Alerts need context; I include queries and next steps every time.
- Document budgets so teams stop arguing about severity.

## What I'm building next

I'm exploring GitHub hooks that block PRs when contracts break. Want to beta it? reach out.

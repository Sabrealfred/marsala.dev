# Data Quality Fire Drills for Growth Teams

> Data crises are easier when you already rehearsed them.

## Context

Whenever a dashboard broke Slack turned into chaos. I instituted monthly drills to train the response muscle.

## Stack I leaned on

- Supabase clones for staging
- dbt seeds with corrupt data
- PagerDuty for simulations
- Notion as the incident logbook

## Playbook

1. Plan realistic scenarios (freshness, duplicates, schema changes).
2. Inject controlled bad data and trigger fake alerts.
3. Run the drill with clear roles (incident commander, scribe, comms).
4. Close with a retro and PRs to improve scripts/tests.
5. Archive learnings and repeat monthly with variations.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Time to detect real incidents: -40%
- Team confidence during incidents: 9/10
- Runbooks updated after drills: 100%

## What stuck with me

- Warn leadership ahead of time to avoid unnecessary escalations.
- Document immediately or the drill evaporates from memory.

## What I'm building next

I'm publishing a library of ready-made scenarios. Want to contribute? DM me.

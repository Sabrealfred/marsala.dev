# Modular Brand Library with Tokens and Version Control

> I stopped chasing logos on Slack once the brand lived in a repo.

## Context

Between marketing and product we had 12 logo versions floating in random Google Drive folders. Slides shipped with outdated colors, growth teams exported unoptimized SVGs, and designers spent hours policing. I rebuilt the brand system as code: tokens, releases, visual QA, and SLAs.

## Stack I leaned on

- Figma libraries + variables feeding Style Dictionary.
- GitHub repo storing tokens (`tokens/`), assets (`assets/`), and release notes.
- Storybook site (with Chromatic) acting as living documentation.
- Cloudinary for CDN + dynamic delivery (format, size, crop).
- Notion portal for non-technical stakeholders with embedded previews.

## Playbook

1. **Inventory & audit** existing assets; map duplicates, owner, usage.
2. **Define taxonomy**: naming conventions (`brand.logo.primary`, `color.brand.moss.500`).
3. **Tokenize** color, type, spacing, motion; convert to JSON via Figma Tokens plugin.
4. **Sync to code** using Style Dictionary → publish `@marsala/brand-tokens` package weekly.
5. **Automate exports**: GitHub Action pulls latest Figma components, optimizes via SVGO/Sharp, uploads to Cloudinary with version tags.
6. **Document in Storybook**: each component example links to tokens, usage guidelines, and download buttons.
7. **Release process**: every two weeks, cut a release (version semver), publish changelog, notify #brand-library.
8. **Request workflow**: Typeform → Linear automation; SLA 3 days for minor variants, 2 weeks for new families.

## Architecture at a Glance

1. **Designers** update Figma components & variables.
2. **Exporter** script pulls tokens + components via API.
3. **GitHub** stores tokens/assets + runs CI for validation, optimization, release.
4. **Delivery** via npm package (tokens) + Cloudinary CDN (assets).
5. **Docs** served via Storybook + Notion with embedded previews.

## Release Pipeline

- Merge to `main` triggers GitHub Action:
  - Validate token schema/naming.
  - Export optimized assets (SVG/PNG/WebP) with metadata.
  - Upload to Cloudinary with semantic version tags.
  - Publish npm package + post changelog to Slack/Notion.
- Run Chromatic visual tests; deploy Storybook on success.
- Releases happen every two weeks; hotfixes use same pipeline but bump patch version.

```yaml
name: brand-release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  tokens:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run tokens:build && npm run assets:export
      - run: npm publish --access public
```

## Request Workflow

- Typeform captures request (use case, deadline, formats).
- n8n creates Linear task, applies SLA (3 days minor, 2 weeks new family).
- Requester tracks status via Notion portal; approvals + delivery links live there.

### SLA Table

| Request Type | Examples | SLA |
|--------------|----------|-----|
| Minor tweak | Color swap, copy edit | 3 business days |
| New variant | Co-brand lockup, localized typography | 10 business days |
| Net-new family | Rebrand, campaign identity | Custom plan reviewed in council |

SLAs are visible to stakeholders so priorities stay aligned.

## Partner Access

- Agencies get Cloudinary keys scoped to read-only directories with auto-expiring tokens.
- Portal logs downloads so we can audit who used which logo variant.
- Self-serve “kit generator” lets partners download combinations (e.g., horizontal + dark background) without pinging design.

## Dashboards & Observability

- Supabase + Metabase track request volume, SLA compliance, asset downloads, and brand debt backlog.
- Grafana board monitors npm token package installs (so we know which repos need updates).
- Slack alerts fire when someone uploads assets outside the pipeline (e.g., manual Cloudinary upload) so we catch rogue files.

## Security & Compliance

- All source files live in GitHub with required reviewers; no more random Dropbox links.
- Cloudinary tokens rotate quarterly; revoked automatically when agencies churn.
- Access logs exported monthly for audits—helpful when legal asks “who downloaded logo v1.4?”

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: inventory assets, define taxonomy, stand up Git repo.
- **Week 2**: connect Figma Tokens → Style Dictionary → npm package.
- **Week 3**: automate exports + Cloudinary uploads, add Storybook/Chromatic.
- **Week 4**: launch Notion portal, train marketing/partners, set SLAs.

## Governance Model

- **Publishers** (Design Ops) approve merges/releases.
- **Contributors** (designers/devs) submit PRs.
- **Consumers** (marketing, growth, partners) consume via Notion + CDN.
- Access roles stored in Supabase; Cloudinary tokens scoped to read-only for partners.
- Monthly “brand council” reviews roadmap, retires outdated assets, and audits open requests. Minutes live alongside release notes so leadership always sees what changed.

## SLA & Metrics

- Urgent asset requests: -70%.
- Multi-brand update time: 6h → 45 min.
- Logo misuse incidents: almost zero.
- Token adoption across squads: 100%.
- Release cadence: every 14 days (tracked in Notion + GitHub).
- SLA compliance for asset requests: 96%.
- Partner satisfaction (quarterly survey): 9.2/10.

## Case Study: Multi-Brand Refresh

When we launched a partner program, we had to ship co-branded kits in four languages:

1. Extended tokens with partner color slots (`color.partner.acme`).
2. Automated export pipeline produced lockups + localized tagline graphics within 2 hours.
3. Storybook showcased combinations and accessibility contrast results.
4. Partners downloaded kits via Notion; audit logs captured who grabbed what.

Time to deliver multi-brand updates dropped from days to under an hour.

## Training & Adoption

- Designers take a “token chef” workshop where they learn naming, merging, and rollback.
- Engineers get a Storybook tour showing how tokens map to Tailwind/SCSS utilities.
- Marketing + partners attend a quarterly office hour to learn portal updates and best practices.
- Everyone signs off on the “brand release checklist” before big campaigns.

## Cost of the Old Way

Before this system we spent ~20 hours/week hunting files and fixing incorrect logos. A single misprinted brochure cost $3k. Investing in automation + governance paid for itself within a month.

## Cost Snapshot

- Figma Organization plan already budgeted.
- Cloudinary: $50/mo for CDN + transformations.
- Chromatic: $60/mo.
- Net incremental spend &lt;$120/mo, saving dozens of designer hours.
That’s cheaper than a single rushed reprint, so finance became our biggest advocate.

## Lessons Learned

- Governance matters: define who can publish and rollback.
- Embedded previews in Notion built trust quickly.
- Treat tokens like APIs: version, deprecate, communicate.
- Train everyone—engineers, marketers, agencies—on the same workflows.
- Automation > policing: scripts catch missing alt text, wrong formats, etc.

## What I'm building next

I'm opening a best-practices guide for teams without dedicated design ops. Want to collaborate? let me know.

Next up: add QA bots that compare live site screenshots vs. Storybook to catch rogue hex codes before they hit production.
Also experimenting with a partner API so agencies can request pre-approved assets programmatically instead of digging through portals.
The better the tooling, the fewer “can you send me the logo?” Slack pings we ever receive.

## FAQ

- **Can non-technical teams use this?** Yes—Notion portal + Cloudinary links hide Git complexity.
- **What if a partner needs a bespoke version?** They submit via request form; we only ship variants that live in the repo so governance stays intact.

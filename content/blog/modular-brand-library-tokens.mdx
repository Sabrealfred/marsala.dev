# Modular Brand Library with Tokens and Version Control

> I stopped chasing logos on Slack once the brand lived in a repo.

## Context

Between marketing and product we had 12 logo versions. I built a library with releases and accessible metadata.

## Stack I leaned on

- Figma libraries + variables
- GitHub repo with optimized assets
- Storybook for living documentation
- Cloudinary for dynamic delivery

## Playbook

1. Inventoried assets and defined consistent naming.
2. Created tokens for color, type and motion, then synced them with code.
3. Automated optimized exports via scripts.
4. Publish release notes and changelog every two weeks.
5. Added request forms for new variants with SLAs.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Urgent asset requests: -70%
- Multi-brand update time: 6h → 45 min
- Logo misuse incidents: almost zero

## What stuck with me

- Governance matters: define who can publish and rollback.
- Embedded previews in Notion built trust quickly.

## What I'm building next

I'm opening a best-practices guide for teams without dedicated design ops. Want to collaborate? let me know.

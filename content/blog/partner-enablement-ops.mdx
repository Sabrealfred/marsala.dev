# Partner Enablement Ops with Actionable Playbooks

> Happy partners sell more; they needed enablement that actually breathes.

## Context

Owning channel revenue taught me that partners get lost without operating guides. I built a modular program that adapts by maturity.

## Stack I leaned on

- Notion + Super.so for the public portal
- Supabase + n8n to track usage
- Resend for educational nurtures
- Attio to score engagement

## Playbook

1. Segmented partners by maturity and needs.
2. Designed content tracks with short modules and quick assessments.
3. Automated reminders based on activity and shared deals.
4. Measured progress with dashboards for consumption + attributed revenue.
5. Hosted bi-weekly office hours to reinforce learning.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Monthly active partners: +41%
- Onboarding time: 4 weeks → 9 days
- Average deal size via partners: +18%

## What stuck with me

- Enablement has to be bite-sized and actionable; no endless PDFs.
- Measuring real usage tells you which modules to tweak without guessing.

## What I'm building next

I'm packaging these modules as a ready-to-clone portal. Want early access? let me know.

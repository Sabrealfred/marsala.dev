# Automating Funnels with n8n Without Torching the CRM

> I promised the team I’d give them their time back, and 17 versioned workflows later I kept that promise.

## Context

I’m the dev who gets paged when Zapier hiccups. One day I moved everything to self-hosted n8n so leads stopped drowning in spreadsheets and duplicated tasks.

## Stack I leaned on

- n8n on Fly.io with Redis queues
- Clearbit Enrichment + Apollo
- Attio API
- Resend + PostHog for nurtures and tracking

## Playbook

1. Wrote JSON contracts for every trigger (forms, calendly, ads) and validated them with Zod.
2. Built custom n8n nodes for scoring to avoid repeated function blocks.
3. Synced everything with Attio using signed webhooks and mapping files.
4. Published Metabase dashboards to see bottlenecks in real time.
5. Set Slack alerts whenever an execution exceeded 90 seconds or hit fallback.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Operations time: 40h → 2h per week
- Misrouted leads: 18% → 2%
- Average time to first reply: 3h → 32 minutes

## What stuck with me

- Without observability you’re blind; I store every payload in Supabase for replays.
- Non-technical owners love visual checklists; I document each play with Mermaid diagrams.

## What I'm building next

I'm testing lightweight models to prioritize sentiment-driven follow-ups. Want help migrating off Zapier or Make? ping me.

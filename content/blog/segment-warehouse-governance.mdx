# Segment-to-Warehouse Governance

> Without governance Segment is trash; with process it’s magic.

## Context

I lead analytics and have seen too many tracking plans scribbled on napkins. Here’s how I keep ours alive and aligned with the warehouse.

## Stack I leaned on

- Segment tracking plan stored as YAML
- dbt tests + Elementary alerts
- Supabase ownership table
- Slack bots for approvals

## Playbook

1. Catalog events with owners and publish them in a repo.
2. Automate validations comparing production payloads vs plan.
3. Route every change through a PR with data + product reviewers.
4. Version downstream transformations and reflect them in dbt.
5. Sync critical fields to the warehouse with consistent naming.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Events without an owner: 0
- Tickets for inconsistent data: -65%
- Time to approve new events: 48h → 12h

## What stuck with me

- Governance needs champions—rotate ownership to avoid burnout.
- Document good/bad event examples so teams learn faster.

## What I'm building next

I'm releasing a versionable tracking-plan template. Drop your email and I’ll share it.

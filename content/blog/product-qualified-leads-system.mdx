# Product Qualified Leads System with Snowflake + Hightouch

> The best leads were already inside the product; they just needed a spotlight.

## Context

I own PLG and hated seeing hot accounts ignored. So I built a pipeline that listens to product activity, predicts intent and pings the right owner.

## Stack I leaned on

- Snowflake + Snowpark for models
- Hightouch for syncing to Attio/HubSpot
- PostHog for feature flags and traits
- Slack bots for instant alerts

## Playbook

1. Defined usage signals (workspaces, automations, seats) and built dbt views.
2. Trained a logistic regression and exposed it as a consumable view.
3. Synced scores to CRM, Slack and product via Hightouch.
4. Added a weekly survey so AEs tag whether the PQL was legit.
5. Retrained the model quarterly with real outcomes.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Pipeline generated internally: +44%
- Win rate on hot PQLs: +18 points
- Reaction time: <30 minutes

## What stuck with me

- Human feedback matters; without AE notes the model gets arrogant.
- Document the logic behind each signal to avoid myths.

## What I'm building next

I'm releasing dbt templates for teams that want to launch PQLs fast. Want them? let me know.

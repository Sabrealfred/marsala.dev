# Modular Design Systems for Scaleups

> I refuse to maintain four copy-paste libraries; layered architectures keep us sane.

## Context

Marketing and product both needed speed. I designed a layered system: core, brand and context components.

## Stack I leaned on

- Figma variables + Style Dictionary
- Storybook ๘ with Chromatic
- Tailwind tokens
- Linear + Notion release notes

## Playbook

1. Classified tokens into core, brand and context layers and versioned them in Git.
2. Synced Figma to code via Style Dictionary.
3. Defined request board with SLAs and weekly rituals.
4. Automated Storybook releases with semantic tags.
5. Documented anti-patterns to avoid rogue components.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Landing launch time: 8 days → 2.5 days
- Component reuse: 78%
- Visual QA tickets: -63%

## What stuck with me

- Design systems need storytelling; otherwise teams think it's a blocker.
- Document when NOT to use a component—it avoids endless debates.

## What I'm building next

I'm preparing a starter kit for teams adopting multi-brand systems. Want in? send me a note.

# Sales Copilot: Gong, Notion and Resend in One Panel

> My AEs no longer spend half an hour writing recaps; the copilot delivers human-sounding drafts.

## Context

I was tired of half-written notes. I developed a copilot that understands our process and fills the gaps.

## Stack I leaned on

- Gong webhooks + secure storage
- OpenAI GPT-4o mini with versioned prompts
- Notion API for deals and next steps
- Resend for follow-ups built with React Email

## Playbook

1. Cached transcripts in encrypted Supabase for auditability.
2. Fed prompts with deal history, stage and risks.
3. Generated summaries, risks and actions straight into Notion.
4. Drafted follow-up emails AEs can tweak in seconds.
5. Collected feedback and retrained prompts weekly.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Time to follow-up: 25 min → 4 min
- Open tasks per deal: 17% → 5%
- Forecast confidence: 62% → 81%

## What stuck with me

- AI needs guardrails; I cap length, tone and required fields.
- AEs adopt faster when they can edit before sending.

## What I'm building next

I'm exploring automatic coaching based on conversation metrics. Want to join the beta? tell me.

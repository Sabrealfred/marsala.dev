# AI Sales Desk Notebook with Unified Context

> AEs stopped juggling 10 tabs—they live in the notebook now.

## Context

Between the CRM, documents and email, context was always missing. I created a sales desk where AI summarizes, suggests and documents in one canvas.

## Stack I leaned on

- Notion with synced blocks for live data
- Attio API to pull pipeline + notes
- OpenAI for summaries and suggestions
- Resend to trigger follow-ups directly

## Playbook

1. Created deal templates with sections for notes, risks and next steps.
2. Synced real-time data from Attio via rollups.
3. Added buttons that draft follow-ups with AI yet keep humans in control.
4. Instrumented access controls and logs for every sensitive action.
5. Captured feedback from reps and shipped iterations every sprint.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Onboarding time for new AEs: -30%
- Complete notes per call: +55%
- Daily desk usage: 94% of the team

## What stuck with me

- AI doesn’t replace judgement; everything stays editable before sending.
- Action-level logging keeps compliance happy.

## What I'm building next

I'll be sharing this desk as a clonable template. Want it? leave me a ping.

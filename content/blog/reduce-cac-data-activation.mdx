# Cutting CAC with Conscious Data Activation

> Instead of burning budget I made the data smarter and focused on the leads that move the needle.

## Context

Finance kept asking for proof. I modeled intent signals, prioritized hot leads and proved we didn’t need more spend.

## Stack I leaned on

- BigQuery + dbt for models
- Hightouch for synced audiences
- Resend Journeys for nurtures
- Metabase for leadership dashboards

## Playbook

1. Classified intent signals (product, marketing, support) and assigned weights.
2. Trained a simple Snowpark model and wrapped it in FastAPI.
3. Automated daily audience syncs per tier with tailored campaigns.
4. Instrumented Slack notifications when a PQL changed status.
5. Compared cohorts pre/post to defend the budget with finance.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Overall CAC: -42%
- Hot PQL win rate: +18 points
- Reaction time to strong signals: <30 minutes

## What stuck with me

- Without consistent naming in the warehouse no automation survives.
- Teams trust the system when they see live dashboards replacing manual reports.

## What I'm building next

Next up: near-real-time activation using Kafka and a lightweight feature store. Want to explore it with me? reach out.

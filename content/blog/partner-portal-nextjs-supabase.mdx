# Partner Portal in 3 Weeks with Next.js + Supabase

> Partners deserved a proper UX; no more endless spreadsheets.

## Context

Channel drives 35% of our pipeline. I crafted a portal because we needed speed and transparency.

## Stack I leaned on

- Next.js App Router + Tailwind
- Supabase Auth and RLS
- Attio + Notion APIs
- Resend for notifications

## Playbook

1. Designed role model (Admin, Sales, Marketing) with Supabase policies.
2. Built modules: shared deals, content hub, incentives, support.
3. Synced Attio webhooks to keep statuses aligned.
4. Added Metabase dashboards for channel metrics.
5. Tested releases with real partners via feature flags.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Partner response time: 24h → <4h
- Shared deals per month: +52%
- Quarterly partner satisfaction: 9.1/10

## What stuck with me

- Partners crave clarity in incentives; expose calculations and statuses.
- Documenting APIs and flows reduced random support tickets.

## What I'm building next

I'm preparing a starter kit for teams using Attio. Want early access? ping me.

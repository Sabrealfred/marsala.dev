# Automation SRE for RevOps

> My RevOps workflows now have SLAs, alerts and on-call rotations just like any critical service.

## Context

Every time a workflow failed, sales chased us. I implemented SRE practices to stabilize automations and sleep better.

## Stack I leaned on

- n8n + healthchecks.io
- Grafana + Loki for logs
- PagerDuty for shared on-call
- Supabase for audit trails

## Playbook

1. Defined SLOs for every critical workflow (latency, availability).
2. Instrumented structured logging and centralized storage.
3. Built error-budget dashboards and maintenance plans.
4. Wrote runbooks and executed quarterly drills.
5. Shared on-call rotations between automation and RevOps.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Incident response time: 25 min → 7 min
- Critical errors/month: -70%
- Sales satisfaction with automations: 9/10

## What stuck with me

- Workflows need owners, alerts and documentation just like microservices.
- Sharing on-call builds empathy between dev and RevOps.

## What I'm building next

I'm releasing runbook + SLO templates for RevOps. Want the bundle? drop your email.

# Launch Readiness Runbook for Calm Releases

> Every launch starts with the same question—are we ready? This runbook gives me the answer.

## Context

Too many rushed launches broke our funnels. I documented the scorecard I use to approve or stop releases.

## Stack I leaned on

- Linear board with gates per area
- Notion template for the scorecard
- Metabase dashboards for pre-launch KPIs
- PagerDuty for launch guard duty

## Playbook

1. Evaluate five dimensions (brand, web, data, automation, ops).
2. Assign owners and risk labels per checklist.
3. Run smoke tests on APIs and front ends.
4. Execute a fire drill 48 hours before go-live.
5. Document a post-launch plan with responsible people.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Launches delayed due to readiness: +2 (worth it)
- Critical incidents after launch: -80%
- Internal satisfaction with the process: 9/10

## What stuck with me

- The scorecard isn’t bureaucracy; it’s a structured conversation.
- Celebrate when someone raises a red flag early.

## What I'm building next

I’m sharing my Notion template soon. Want it? leave me your email.

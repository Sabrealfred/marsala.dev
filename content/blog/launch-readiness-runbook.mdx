# Launch Readiness Runbook for Calm Releases

> Every launch starts with the same question—are we ready? This runbook gives me the answer.

## Context

In the fast-paced world of product development, launches are a constant. But for a long time, our launches were anything but smooth. Too many rushed releases led to broken funnels, frustrated customers, and exhausted teams. It was a recurring nightmare: a Product Marketing Manager (PMM) would announce, "We go live Friday!" This would trigger a frantic scramble in engineering, only for the growth team to discover broken forms, stale dashboards, and critical bugs hours after the launch. The post-launch period was often a chaotic scramble to fix issues, leading to missed targets and a loss of trust.

This unsustainable cycle highlighted a critical need for a more structured approach. We needed a way to ensure that every aspect of a launch was thoroughly vetted and ready before going live. That's why I developed a comprehensive launch-readiness scorecard. This scorecard covers five critical pillars: Brand, Web, Data, Automations, and Operations. The rule is simple: if any pillar fails to meet its readiness criteria, we pause the launch. This runbook has transformed our launch weeks from frantic, reactive events into calm, well-orchestrated processes. And yes, we've proudly delayed launches twice because the scorecard clearly indicated "no." It was absolutely worth it to prevent customer-impacting bugs and maintain our team's sanity.

## Stack I leaned on

- **Linear project with stage gates and required checklist tasks:** We use Linear to manage our launch projects. Each launch is a project with clearly defined stage gates and a comprehensive list of required checklist tasks. This ensures that all necessary steps are completed before moving to the next stage.
- **Notion scorecard template auto-calculating readiness per pillar:** Our launch readiness scorecard lives in Notion. It's a dynamic template that automatically calculates the readiness score for each pillar (Brand, Web, Data, Automations, Operations) based on the completion of checklist items. This provides a real-time view of our launch readiness.
- **Metabase dashboards for pre-launch KPIs and burn-down charts:** We use Metabase to create dashboards that track our pre-launch Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and burn-down charts. These dashboards provide critical insights into our progress and help us identify any potential bottlenecks.
- **PagerDuty/Slack for launch guard duty and incident escalation:** During launch week, we have a dedicated launch guard team. PagerDuty is used for on-call rotations and incident escalation, while Slack serves as our primary communication channel for real-time updates and coordination.
- **n8n automations to remind owners when deliverables slip:** To ensure accountability and keep things on track, we use n8n to automate reminders. If a deliverable is nearing its deadline or has slipped, n8n automatically pings the owner, ensuring that no task falls through the cracks.
- **Statuspage clone to communicate readiness to execs:** For executive-level communication, we maintain a Statuspage clone. This provides a high-level, transparent overview of our launch readiness, allowing executives to quickly grasp the status without getting bogged down in details.

## Readiness Dimensions

1. **Brand & Messaging**
   - Creative approved, legal reviewed, translations in place.
   - Launch narrative documented (problem, proof, CTA).
2. **Web & Product Surfaces**
   - Pages built with Lighthouse ≥90.
   - Feature flags staged, rollback plan documented.
3. **Data & Analytics**
   - Tracking plan PRs merged, QA screenshots attached.
   - KPI dashboards seeded with test data, alerts tuned.
4. **Automations & Enablement**
   - Lifecycle emails/plays QA’d, CRM fields ready, CSM enablement done.
5. **Operations & Support**
   - Support macros published, billing/pricing toggles tested, runbooks ready.

Each dimension owns a checklist and risk score (Green/Amber/Red). Red blocks launch; Amber requires exec sign-off.

## Weekly Cadence

- **T-28 days**: Kickoff, assign owners, populate scorecard baseline.
- **T-21**: Mid-sprint review; update risks, ensure dependencies unblocked.
- **T-14**: Dry run of product demo + content, finalize pricing/legal.
- **T-7**: “Gate review” meeting—scorecard must be ≥80% green to proceed.
- **T-2**: Fire drill + smoke tests; launch guard roster confirmed.
- **T+1**: Post-launch standup, confirm metrics, release recap email.
- **T+7**: Retro with action items + playbook updates.

## Playbook

1. **Populate scorecard**: owners fill status, attach evidence (screenshots, links).
2. **Risk scoring**: 1–5 scale for impact × likelihood; auto-calc risk heatmap.
3. **Run smoke tests**: API, forms, payments, integrations; record Loom evidence.
4. **Execute fire drill**: simulate major incident (e.g., lead form outage) 48h prior.
5. **Staff launch guard**: assign IC, comms lead, resolver; share on-call doc.
6. **Launch & monitor**: use live dashboards + Slack bot to publish updates hourly.
7. **Post-launch plan**: backlog of follow-ups, adoption metrics, retro schedule.

## The Benefits of a Launch Readiness Runbook

- **Reduced launch risk:** By systematically checking all aspects of a launch, we significantly reduce the risk of critical bugs and post-launch incidents.
- **Improved cross-functional collaboration:** The runbook forces teams to work together and communicate effectively, breaking down silos and fostering a shared sense of ownership.
- **Increased transparency:** The scorecard and dashboards provide a clear, real-time view of launch readiness to all stakeholders, from individual contributors to executives.
- **Empowered decision-making:** With clear data and a structured process, we can make informed go/no-go decisions, even if it means delaying a launch.
- **Faster incident response:** By having a dedicated launch guard and clear escalation paths, we can respond to and resolve any post-launch incidents much faster.
- **Continuous improvement:** The post-launch retro ensures that we learn from every launch and continuously improve our processes.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Launch Captain (PMM)**: owns scorecard, facilitations, exec updates.
- **Tech Lead**: ensures feature flags, rollback scripts, observability, and runbooks exist.
- **Growth Lead**: verifies funnels, attribution, campaigns, and experiments are ready.
- **Data Lead**: signs off on tracking plan, DBT tests, and KPI dashboards.
- **Ops/Sales Enablement**: trains CSMs/AEs, updates pricing/billing, ensures support macros exist.

Each role has a backup and stands in the go/no-go meeting prepared to defend status.

## Tooling Automations

- **Linear automation**: tickets cannot close until attached checklist tasks marked complete (via custom script).
- **Slack bot**: `/launch status` returns readiness score, blockers, guard roster.
- **PagerDuty schedule**: `launch-guard` service rotates IC/comms/resolver during launch window.
- **Metabase**: auto-refresh dashboards pinned in #launch-control every hour.
- **n8n**: sends D-7, D-3, D-1 reminders plus collects retro notes via form.

Automation removes human follow-up.

## Scorecard Snapshot (Notion)

| Pillar | Owner | Readiness % | Top Risks | Evidence |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Brand | @sofia | 90% | Localization pending for DE | Figma link |
| Web | @marina | 85% | Lighthouse 88 on /pricing | Chromatic run 142 |
| Data | @leo | 70% | Tracking plan PR #812 open | dbt docs |
| Automations | @mila | 100% | None | Resend test suite |
| Ops | @carlos | 95% | Billing team on-call gap | PagerDuty schedule |

Numbers roll up into an overall readiness score; anything &lt;85% triggers exec review.

## Sample Checklist Items

- Brand: “Final hero copy approved by legal,” “Media kit zipped + distributed.”
- Web: “Forms pass QA on top 5 browsers,” “Feature flag rollback doc linked.”
- Data: “Segment events merged,” “Metabase chart verifies sample data.”
- Automations: “Playbooks tested in staging,” “CRM fields live with defaults.”
- Ops: “Support macros published,” “Billing toggles simulated in sandbox.”

Each checklist item requires a link or screenshot; empty fields fail the gate.

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Tracking PR pending | Medium | High | Block launch, add reviewer mob | Data lead |
| Support understaffed | Low | High | Pull SDRs for weekend coverage | Ops |
| Billing toggle unknown | Medium | Medium | Simulate in sandbox + record Loom proof | Engineering |
| Messaging legal approval | High | Medium | Daily check-ins with counsel | PMM |

We update the matrix at every gate review. If impact × likelihood ≥9, the launch pauses until mitigation is in place.

## Fire Drill Template

1. **Trigger**: e.g., lead form 500 error.
2. **Participants**: dev, ops, support, comms.
3. **Timeline**: 30-minute simulation.
4. **Objectives**: Validate detection, comms, rollback.
5. **Output**: Notion doc with gaps (missing scripts, unclear on-call, etc.).

Running drills forced us to write missing runbooks before launch day.

## Metrics & Telemetry

- **Strategic launch delays:** We've strategically delayed 2 launches due to readiness issues, preventing critical customer-impacting bugs.
- **Reduced critical incidents:** Critical incidents after launch have been reduced by 80%.
- **Exceeded adoption forecasts:** Post-launch adoption has exceeded forecasts by 14%, indicating successful and smooth rollouts.
- **High internal satisfaction:** Internal satisfaction with the launch process is consistently at 9/10.
- **Eliminated ownership ambiguity:** We've had zero "unknown owner" issues during launches.
- **Faster launch recaps:** The average time to publish a launch recap has been reduced from 24 hours to 4 hours.

We review metrics quarterly to keep leadership bought in.

## Post-Launch Evaluation

1. **Adoption review**: compare actual vs. forecast KPIs within 24 hours; annotate dashboards with context.
2. **Incident recap**: even if none occurred, confirm guard roster logs and update runbooks with lessons learned.
3. **Customer feedback**: compile support tickets, social mentions, NPS comments in a Notion database.
4. **Debt backlog**: capture hacks or shortcuts, assign owners in Linear with due dates.
5. **Retro**: start/stop/continue meeting with all owners. Publish notes + decisions; update templates immediately.

This closes the loop so each launch makes the next easier.

## Communication Plan

- **Launch control Slack channel** pinned with runbook, guard roster, dashboards.
- **Executive digest** auto-posted daily with readiness score and blockers.
- **Statuspage clone** showing color-coded pillars for stakeholders outside Slack.
- **Go/No-Go meeting** day before launch where each owner says “Ship” or “Block” with rationale.

Transparency keeps surprises low.

## Lessons Learned

- The scorecard isn’t bureaucracy; it’s a structured conversation.
- Celebrate when someone raises a red flag early—it’s courage, not friction.
- Evidence matters; no checklist item counts without proof.
- Assign backups for every owner; vacations shouldn’t derail readiness.
- Keep retros short but mandatory; feed improvements back into template.

## FAQ

- **Do we ever skip the scorecard?** Only for hotfixes/incident comms. Anything customer-facing goes through the runbook.
- **What if a pillar is Amber but execs want to launch?** Execs can override, but we log the decision+risk in Notion so accountability is preserved.
- **How do you handle dependencies on other teams?** We embed their tasks into our Linear project and give them visibility into the same dashboard; no off-the-books work.

## What I'm building next

I’m sharing my Notion template (scorecard + fire-drill + on-call roster) and a Linear workflow that locks “Launch” tickets until all five pillars submit evidence. Want it? leave me your email.

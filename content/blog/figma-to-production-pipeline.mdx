# Figma to Production Without Friction

> I made peace with Figma when the handoff literally became a PR.

## Context

I'm a developer who loves visual craft. I built a pipeline where every Figma change mirrors Storybook and lands as a tagged release.

## Stack I leaned on

- Figma variables + tokens
- Style Dictionary for exports
- Storybook 8 with Chromatic
- Next.js + Tailwind token utilities

## Playbook

1. Sync color/type variables weekly into a private npm package.
2. Create design PRs just like code, with assigned reviewers.
3. Run visual tests in Chromatic and publish release notes for product.
4. Coach marketing on how to play inside the playground before go-live.
5. Version assets and mission-critical copy alongside the code release.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Visual bugs in production: -70%
- Handoff time: 4 days → 1.5 days
- Token adoption across squads: 100%

## What stuck with me

- Variables need owners; design ops without guardrails is chaos.
- Storybook becomes the single source of truth only if everything gets reviewed there.

## What I'm building next

I'm adding linters that compare frames vs components and raise PRs. Want in? I'll loop you when it's ready.

# Merging CRMs: HubSpot + Attio Without Losing History

> I had to clean the mess of parallel CRMs—and lived to tell the tale.

## Context

After an acquisition we ended up with two CRMs fighting each other. I designed a controlled merge with staging, QA and clear comms.

## Stack I leaned on

- Airbyte + dbt for extraction and mapping
- Supabase staging with RLS rules
- Attio API to create final records
- Notion playbooks + Slack updates

## Playbook

1. Cataloged properties and flagged equivalences/conflicts.
2. Designed dedupe rules with fuzzy + deterministic matches.
3. Migrated in waves by account segments to reduce risk.
4. Rebuilt critical automations in Attio with unit tests.
5. Delivered training and health dashboards post-merge.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Records migrated successfully: 118k (98.7%)
- Automations re-enabled: 15 in two weeks
- Support tickets post-migration: &lt;10

## What stuck with me

- Merges fail due to poor communication; send daily status and public dashboards.
- Owners must validate their own data before anything gets deleted.

## What I'm building next

I'm building reusable merge scripts; need one? reach out and we’ll adapt it.

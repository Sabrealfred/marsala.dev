# Experimentation Rituals That Actually Scale

> Experiments stopped being random bets—they became part of our heartbeat.

## Context

With multiple squads testing in parallel we needed order. I defined rituals that let us ship continuously with reliable data.

## Stack I leaned on

- Linear board dedicated to experiments
- Notion playbooks with A/B templates
- PostHog for tracking and analysis
- #experiments Slack channel for updates

## Playbook

1. Weekly intake using a template (hypothesis, metric, owner).
2. Prioritize with ICE score plus real capacity.
3. Cross-team QA before flipping any flag.
4. Friday demo + retro capturing actionable learnings.
5. Auto-archive experiments with documentation snapshots.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Velocity: 1 experiment/month → 4 per sprint
- Completed analysis: 100%
- Repeat mistakes: near zero

## What stuck with me

- Transparency motivates—everyone sees what’s being tested and why.
- Documenting failed tests prevents rerunning them two months later.

## What I'm building next

I'm integrating AI to propose hypotheses from insights. Want to co-create that layer? let's talk.

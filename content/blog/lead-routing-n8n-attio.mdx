# Lead Routing with n8n + Attio

> The router understands real availability, not just territory copied from an outdated Excel.

## Context

Leads were being assigned at random. I built a dynamic router with transparent rules so nothing falls through the cracks.

## Stack I leaned on

- n8n hosted on Railway
- Attio API
- Supabase for load history
- Slack buttons for accept/reassign

## Playbook

1. Gathered signals: segment, industry, load and timezone.
2. Built custom functions in n8n that return the ideal owner.
3. Updated Attio with the assignment and triggered tasks automatically.
4. Notified Slack with accept/reassign buttons.
5. Added a Retool dashboard to pause owners on PTO.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Time to first contact: &lt;15 minutes
- Lead acceptance rate: 93%
- Load deviation across owners: -41%

## What stuck with me

- Automatic pause is critical; otherwise people on PTO keep receiving leads.
- All rules live in a repo—no secret spreadsheets allowed.

## What I'm building next

Next I'm adding a fairness model. Want to try it in your team? let me know.

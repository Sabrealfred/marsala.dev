# Attio Migration Playbook

> I promised zero all-nighters and delivered a clean cutover.

## Context

I love Attio because I can shape it to my process. This migration was my final exam: 120k records, 37 properties and multi-team workflows.

## Stack I leaned on

- Airbyte + dbt for extraction and normalization
- Attio API + TypeScript scripts
- Supabase for staging/QA
- Notion + Loom for enablement

## Playbook

1. Defined success criteria and blocked a freeze window.
2. Created field mapping and dedupe rules versioned in Git.
3. Ran a dress rehearsal with 5% of data and documented gaps.
4. Rebuilt automations with Attio Actions and tests.
5. Delivered trainings and a health dashboard after cutover.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Data completeness: 99.3%
- Automations rebuilt: 12 in three days
- Annual stack cost: -42%

## What stuck with me

- Owners need 5-minute video walk-throughs per flow.
- Never ignore obscure properties; there's always a hidden integration.

## What I'm building next

I'm packaging this playbook into a CLI. Want to test it? DM me.

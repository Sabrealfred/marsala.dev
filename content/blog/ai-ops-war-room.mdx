# AI Ops War Room: Live Control Board for Operations

> The war room lives in a dark dashboard where AI summarizes and suggests actions.

## Context

Ops meetings were a mix of spreadsheets, stale dashboards, and ping-pong in Slack. I created a digital “war room” that unifies metrics, alerts, and AI copilots so the team makes decisions in minutes. The war room is a Notion + Metabase hub, backed by Snowflake and PostHog, with OpenAI function calls that summarize and trigger playbooks.

## Architecture Overview

- **Data sources**: Snowflake (finance + ops), PostHog (product), Zendesk (support), Stripe (billing).
- **Processing**: dbt + Metaplane for tests; metrics published to Metabase.
- **War room UI**: Notion page embedded with Metabase dashboards + custom React widgets (Next.js microfrontends served via Vercel embeds).
- **AI Copilot**: OpenAI function calling with guardrails; uses metrics + playbook metadata to draft actions.
- **Automation hooks**: n8n workflows and PagerDuty incidents triggered via buttons.

```
Snowflake/dbt ---> Metabase ---> Notion embeds
      |                          |
PostHog ---> Supabase (anomalies) ---> OpenAI Copilot ---> n8n playbooks
```

## Core Components

1. **Mission KPIs**: three metrics per track (MRR growth, lead velocity, support backlog) with budgets + trendlines.
2. **Anomaly Feed**: Metaplane + PostHog webhooks push anomalies into Supabase; AI summarizes impact + suggested playbooks.
3. **Playbook Library**: Notion database versioned in Git (YAML exported). Each playbook has trigger, steps, owners, automation hooks.
4. **Action Log**: Supabase table storing who triggered what, outcome, follow-up tasks.

## Playbook for Building the War Room

### 1. Define Signals & Budgets
- Work with execs to pick 3 KPIs per domain (Growth, Product, Support, Finance).
- Document budgets (e.g., churn must stay &lt;1.5% monthly) and escalation policies.

### 2. Build the Data Backbone
- Consolidate metrics in Snowflake; dbt models output `fct_kpi_daily` and `fct_anomaly_events`.
- Tests ensure freshness + accuracy; failures page the ops guard.

### 3. Layer the UI
- Metabase dashboards for charts, embedded via secure tokens in Notion.
- Custom Next.js widgets (CTA buttons, chat-like action log) using Notion’s embed block.

### 4. Wire AI Copilot
- Prompt template summarizing KPIs, anomalies, and recommended playbooks.
- Function calling available actions (`trigger_playbook`, `open_incident`, `summarize_status`).
- Guardrails so AI can’t trigger actions above severity level without human confirmation.

### 5. Automate Playbooks
- Each playbook stored as YAML: trigger → inputs → n8n workflow ID.
- Buttons in the war room call API to launch n8n run; status fed back into Action Log.

```yaml
id: support_surge_plan
severity: 2
triggers:
  - metric: support_backlog
    condition: "> 150"
steps:
  - type: n8n
    workflow_id: support-surge
  - type: slack
    channel: "#support-war-room"
    template: surge_notice.md
approvals:
  required_roles: ["IC","Support Lead"]
```

Every button references a definition like this so we can audit what changed between versions.

### 6. Rollout & Training
- Weekly ops sync inside the war room; every discussion references dashboards + AI summaries.
- Guard rotation (see below) ensures someone owns alerts 24/7.
- Publish a Loom walkthrough + mini quiz so every new operator knows how to read budgets, trigger playbooks, and log actions.

### 7. Implementation Timeline

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Define KPIs/budgets, design dashboard layout, list playbooks |
| 2 | Build Snowflake/dbt layers, connect Metabase, set up anomaly feed |
| 3 | Prototype AI Copilot + action log in Supabase |
| 4 | Integrate n8n playbooks, run drills, onboard guard rotation |
| 5 | Roll out to broader org, create read-only views for marketing/finance |

## Guard Rotation

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| IC | Triage anomalies, drive decisions, log actions |
| Comms | Post updates in #ops-war-room, escalate to execs |
| Automation lead | Launch playbooks, monitor workflows |

PagerDuty schedule rotates weekly. Drills run monthly to keep muscles sharp.

### Guard Checklist

- Check anomaly feed every hour.
- Verify Copilot summaries (accuracy + recommended playbooks).
- Ensure Action Log entries have owners and follow-up dates.
- Host a 10-minute end-of-shift handoff Loom for the next guard.

## Metrics & Impact

- **Reduced meeting time:** Daily stand-up time dropped from 45 minutes to 18 minutes because decisions were already prepared.
- **Faster alert handling:** Alerts were handled in under 10 minutes (p90).
- **Full accountability:** 100% of actions were logged with owners, creating an auditable trail.
- **Increased efficiency:** AI suggestions were adopted 62% of the time, saving approximately 4 hours per week.
- **Improved budget adherence:** Budget breaches were reduced from 6 per quarter to only 1.

## Sample Workflow

1. Metaplane detects spike in support backlog.
2. Alert hits Supabase; AI summary posts in war room with suggested playbook (“Activate support surge plan”).
3. IC reviews, clicks “Run surge plan” button.
4. n8n opens PagerDuty incident, notifies on-call CS, spins up Slack channel, adjusts Zendesk priorities.
5. Action log records everything; Notion page updates automatically.

## Action Log Schema

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `action_id` | UUID for traceability |
| `triggered_by` | Slack handle of human who approved/ran the action |
| `playbook_id` | References YAML definition |
| `inputs` | JSON payload sent to n8n |
| `status` | Pending / Running / Completed / Rolled back |
| `postmortem_link` | Optional link if action escalated to incident |

We expose this table directly in Notion so execs can audit decisions without pinging ops leads.

## Case Study: Q4 Infrastructure Incident

- Snowflake warehouse stalled during peak renewal week.
- Anomaly hit the war room; Copilot summarized impact (“MRR forecast at risk, ingestion lag 45 min”) and suggested playbook “Switch to backup warehouse + pause heavy jobs”.
- IC launched the playbook: n8n invoked Terraform to scale the standby warehouse, triggered PagerDuty for data engineering, and posted status updates with countdown timers.
- Within 14 minutes the backlog cleared, and finance received a single Slack thread documenting the fix. No frantic DMs, no conflicting dashboards.

## Communication Rhythm

- **Morning brief**: Copilot posts KPI summary + anomalies at 8am local time.
- **Midday update**: guard shares decisions taken + blockers in #ops-war-room.
- **EOD digest**: automated summary of actions, incidents, outstanding items; execs read it asynchronously.
- **Weekly exec note**: condensed version emailed to leadership, linking to action log + upcoming risks.

## Lessons Learned

- The war room doesn’t replace human judgment—it accelerates it.
- Playbooks must be editable from the dashboard; buried docs kill adoption.
- Copilot needs context + guardrails; otherwise it hallucinates action plans.
- Logging is non-negotiable; exec trust comes from audits.
- Communication cadence is as important as tooling—quiet war rooms get ignored.
- Document playbooks like code; YAML + Git reviews prevented people from running stale instructions.
- Run postmortems even for “successful” actions—the guard rotation reviews action logs weekly and files small retro notes when something felt clunky. Those micro-retros keep the war room evolving instead of calcifying.

## FAQ

**How do you keep AI summaries accurate?**
We feed the model only curated metrics + context (budgets, deltas) and cap temperature at 0.2. Humans confirm before execution.

**What if someone triggers the wrong playbook?**
Each action requires confirmation + reason. The guard can roll back via n8n or trigger “undo” playbook.

**Can teams outside ops use the war room?**
Yes—marketing has a read-only view, and AI can draft weekly exec briefs automatically.

**What about security?**
Every action is authenticated via Supabase, and OpenAI requests run through a proxy that strips sensitive fields. Only the IC can press automation buttons; others can comment.

**Do you version playbooks?**
Yes—GitHub hosts YAML definitions; pull requests include reviewers from ops, eng, and compliance before a button becomes available in the UI.

## What I'm building next

Using smaller local models (OpenAI GPT‑4o mini + Llama Guard) for anomaly detection at the edge, plus integrating budget burn-down charts directly into Slack.
- Building an “Ops API” so other teams can query the same action log, subscribe to anomaly events, and embed mini-war-room widgets in their own dashboards.

## Cost Snapshot

- Metabase Pro + embedding: $150/mo.
- OpenAI GPT‑4o mini usage: ~$120/mo (summaries + copilot).
- n8n on Fly.io: $25/mo.
- PagerDuty: part of global plan (allocated ~$80/mo to ops).
- Total spend &lt;$400/mo to keep ops decisions centralized and fast.
One avoided outage easily covers that bill—the Q4 incident saved a six-figure renewal.
The tooling cost is trivial compared to the clarity and speed we gained.
- Compare that to a single incident causing hours of downtime; the ROI justified itself after the first quarter.

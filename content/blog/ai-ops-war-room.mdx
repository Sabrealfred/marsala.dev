# AI Ops War Room: Live Control Board for Operations

> The war room lives in a dark dashboard where AI summarizes and suggests actions.

## Context

As we grew every team brought its own dashboard. I designed a digital war room with unified metrics and copilots that propose plans.

## Stack I leaned on

- Metabase + Notion for timeline and metrics
- PostHog + Snowflake for fresh data
- OpenAI function calling for playbooks
- PagerDuty/Slack for incidents

## Playbook

1. Pick three critical metrics per front (MRR, leads, support) and set budgets.
2. Automate daily summaries with AI to highlight relevant changes.
3. Add buttons to execute playbooks (activate nurture, pause campaign).
4. Version every playbook in Git and surface it in the dashboard.
5. Log actions and owners for historical accountability.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Daily stand-up: 45 min → 18 min
- Alerts handled in <10 minutes
- Actions with documented owners: 100%

## What stuck with me

- The war room doesn’t replace human decisions—it accelerates them.
- Playbooks must be editable from the dashboard, not buried in a doc.

## What I'm building next

Next step: use small local models for early anomaly detection. Want to try it with me? let me know.

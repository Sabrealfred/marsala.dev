# Customer Journeys Orchestrated with Resend + Segment

> Journeys stopped being generic blasts and became useful conversations.

## Context

I lead growth but think like a dev. I created modular journeys where each stage uses real data and living copy managed in Notion.

## Stack I leaned on

- Segment for event capture and fan-out
- Resend + React Email for versioned templates
- Notion as an editable CMS
- n8n for timers and conditions

## Playbook

1. Mapped stages (onboarding, adoption, expansion) with triggers and KPIs.
2. Stored copy/assets in Notion with stable IDs that Resend reads.
3. Configured n8n flows that watch activity and fire the right email.
4. Ran QA with Mailosaur and real inboxes before launch.
5. Tracked impact in PostHog to see which modules move metrics.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Activation rate: +31%
- Time-to-value: -42%
- Quarterly upsell ARR: +18%

## What stuck with me

- Versioning templates is mandatory; we use Git + PRs for copy changes.
- Journeys need off-ramps; always offer a path to support or the CSM.

## What I'm building next

I'm building email components marketing can remix without touching code. Want to see it? reach out.

# Privacy Layer for Growth Teams

> There’s no sustainable growth without trust; the privacy layer is my insurance policy.

## Context

I work with sensitive data. To move quickly without violating GDPR or SOC2, I created a privacy layer that abstracts PII and documents every use.

## Stack I leaned on

- Supabase + Row Level Security
- HashiCorp Vault for keys and secrets
- Segment consent mode + OneTrust
- PostHog proxy for anonymous events

## Playbook

1. Classified data by sensitivity and defined access rules.
2. Tokenized emails/IDs before sending them to external tools.
3. Implemented a legal-owned consent panel.
4. Documented data purposes with automatic expiry rules.
5. Automated audit reports each sprint.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Deletion requests served in &lt;48h
- Privacy incidents in 2024: 0
- Time to approve new tools: -40%

## What stuck with me

- Legal needs real-time visibility of where data travels.
- Teams accept constraints when they see the upside (fewer endless forms).

## What I'm building next

I’m building a CLI that lists which services touch PII. Want to beta test it? ping me.

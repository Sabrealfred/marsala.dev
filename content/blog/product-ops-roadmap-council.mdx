# Product Ops Roadmap Council: Less Noise, More Focus

> The roadmap stopped living in a static PDF—it became a living process.

## Context

With multiple squads clashing for priorities I needed a neutral forum. The council happens once a month and decisions are grounded on data and real capacity.

## Stack I leaned on

- Notion database powering the live roadmap
- Metabase dashboards for impact metrics
- Linear for status and dependencies
- Resend for automated meeting notes

## Playbook

1. Collect proposals via a single template with owner + expected metric.
2. Review metrics/risks in a short synchronous session.
3. Vote using predefined criteria and log the decision in Notion.
4. Send auto recaps via Resend and update Linear tickets immediately.
5. Run bi-weekly check-ins with owners to keep initiatives on track.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Decision time for big bets: -50%
- Projects without a clear owner: 0
- Plan vs reality alignment: +35%

## What stuck with me

- Transparency kills hallway rumors—everyone sees why we said yes or no.
- Current data is non-negotiable; otherwise the council becomes opinion wars.

## What I'm building next

I'm polishing the template with scoring matrix + agendas. Want it? drop me your email.

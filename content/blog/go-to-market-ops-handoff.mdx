# Go-to-Market Ops Handoff Without Losing Context

> I never green-light an experiment unless I know who will run it afterwards.

## Context

Too many experiments die because they never get productized. I built a handoff framework that forces us to document owners, metrics and runbooks.

## Stack I leaned on

- Linear for the shared roadmap
- Notion + Loom for handbooks
- Supabase to check exit metrics
- Slack workflows for reminders

## Playbook

1. Ask five key questions before closing a sprint (owner, metric, risks, playbooks, backlog).
2. Record five-minute walkthroughs that travel with every handoff.
3. Verify instrumentation and alerts before the build squad shuts down.
4. Create status dashboards so operations can monitor without pinging engineering.
5. Schedule quarterly retros to adjust process and tooling.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Initiatives still alive after three months: 92%
- Transition time to ops: 14 days → 4 days
- Incidents due to missing context: -60%

## What stuck with me

- A solid handoff needs storytelling; cold documents flop.
- Operations must show up in discovery, not only at the finish line.

## What I'm building next

I'm writing a reusable template for any squad. Want to pilot it? leave me your email.

# Go-to-Market Ops Handoff Without Losing Context

> I never green-light an experiment unless I know who will run it afterwards.

## Context

Too many experiments die because they never get productized. Growth teams celebrate a win, then throw a Notion doc over the fence to operations. Weeks later the play stops working, nobody knows who owns alerts, and leadership questions why we invested at all. I built a handoff framework that forces us to capture owners, metrics, runbooks, and dependencies before we declare victory. It behaves like a contract: if ops can’t run it on day one, we aren’t done shipping.

## Stack I leaned on

- Linear for the shared roadmap
- Notion + Loom for handbooks
- Supabase to check exit metrics
- Slack workflows for reminders

## The Five Questions We Answer

1. **Owner**: Who runs the play after launch? Include backup owner and escalation path.
2. **Metric**: Which KPI proves it’s working, and where is that metric instrumented?
3. **Runbook**: What steps, scripts, and SLAs keep the play healthy?
4. **Risks & guardrails**: What could break (capacity, compliance, dependencies) and how do we monitor it?
5. **Backlog & roadmap**: Which follow-up tasks remain, and who prioritizes them?

The experiment doesn’t close in Linear until each question has a documented answer and the ops lead signs off.

## Handoff Packet Anatomy

| Section | Tool | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Summary + video | Notion + Loom | 5-minute walkthrough showing flows, metrics, and failure modes |
| Process checklist | Notion template | Step-by-step instructions with links to scripts, dashboards |
| Data contract | Supabase / dbt docs | Defines tables, fields, freshness targets, alert thresholds |
| Automation map | Miro diagram embedded | Shows n8n/Zapier/Fly flows with owners |
| SLA + escalation | PagerDuty runbook | Who is paged, how fast, what “good” looks like |
| Backlog | Linear project | Remaining items labeled “post-handoff” with owners and due dates |

Ops can ramp by consuming the packet without booking extra meetings.

## Playbook

1. **Co-design during discovery**: Ops lead joins the kickoff and helps define success metrics + constraints. No late surprises.
2. **Instrument exit criteria**: Supabase + Metabase dashboards watch the KPI for two weeks pre-handoff. If it’s unstable, we keep it in the build squad.
3. **Create the packet**: Growth squad fills in the Notion template, records Loom walkthrough, and links every script or dashboard. Slack workflow reminds them 48h before the handoff review.
4. **Live handoff meeting**: 30-minute session where growth demos the play, ops runs it themselves, and we capture open questions. Meeting recorded and linked back to the packet.
5. **Shadow period**: For two weeks ops runs the play with growth on standby. Alerts route to both teams, so knowledge transfer happens via real incidents.
6. **Formal sign-off**: Once ops confirms they can operate without help, the experiment is archived in growth backlog and moved to the ops roadmap.
7. **Quarterly retros**: Ops + growth review which handoffs succeeded, which slipped, and what tooling/process needs updates.

## Contracts & Checklists

- **Experiment contract**: single-page doc that states scope, KPIs, dependencies, and support model. Signed by PM, Ops lead, and RevOps director.
- **Run checklist**: e.g., for a lifecycle email play: verify segment sync, run A/B test schedule, check unsubscribe alerts, deploy new creative. Each step links to script or UI path.
- **Stop checklist**: criteria for pausing or rolling back (metric drop, deliverability issues, compliance review).

Checklists live as Notion databases so we track completion and spot skipped steps.

## Instrumentation & Alerts

- **Supabase triggers** track metric thresholds and push updates to Slack (#gtm-health).
- **PagerDuty light policy** ensures someone is paged if the KPI breaches for >4 hours.
- **Metabase dashboards** show daily performance, backlog tasks, and on-call schedule for the play, giving leadership transparency.

Handoffs fail when ops inherits a black box; we make telemetry part of the deliverable.

## Metrics & telemetry

- **Initiatives still alive after three months**: 92% (up from 54%).
- **Transition time to ops**: 14 days → 4 days because artifacts exist before the meeting.
- **Incidents due to missing context**: -60%.
- **Average onboarding hours per ops analyst**: -35% once Loom + checklists became standard.
- **Executive confidence score**: 9/10 in quarterly survey (“I know who owns launched plays.”)

## Sample Handoff Timeline

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| -7  | Ops joins discovery sync, confirms KPIs + constraints |
| -3  | Growth squad drafts packet skeleton, records first Loom |
| -2  | Slack workflow pings owners to finalize runbooks/alerts |
| 0   | Live handoff walkthrough + Q&A |
| +3  | Ops runs play with growth shadowing; log issues in Notion |
| +7  | Shadow period review; tune alerts/dashboards |
| +14 | Formal sign-off + backlog transfer |

By visualizing the timeline we eliminated last-minute scrambles.

## Cost & Tooling Snapshot

- **Linear**: already in use; we added templates and automations (no extra cost).
- **Notion**: $8/user; playbook templates live here with relational databases.
- **Loom**: $12/user for recording walkthroughs.
- **Supabase**: free tier for monitoring exit metrics; upgraded to Pro ($25/mo) once we tracked >1M rows.
- **Slack workflow builder**: part of Slack Pro plan; sends reminders and routes approvals.

Under $100/mo in incremental tooling to keep multi-million dollar plays alive.

## Common Failure Modes (and Fixes)

1. **Docs without narrative** → We require Loom walkthroughs; humans remember stories better than bullet points.
2. **Ops looped in too late** → Add ops to discovery invites automatically via Slack workflow.
3. **Invisible backlog** → Post-handoff tasks stay in Linear under an “Ops” team board with clear owners, not in secret spreadsheets.
4. **Alert fatigue** → During shadow period we tune alerts; ops cannot inherit noisy PagerDuty rules.
5. **Tool access gaps** → Handoff checklist includes “permissions verified” for every system (Segment, Resend, n8n, Metabase).

## Cultural Tactics

- **Demo days**: every Friday ops demos one newly adopted play to the broader team. Reinforces accountability and creates a feedback loop.
- **Office hours**: growth squad hosts a weekly 30-minute slot for ops questions during the first month post-handoff.
- **Recognition**: we shout out ops leads in #wins when a handoff goes smoothly. Incentives matter.
- **Runbook drills**: once a quarter ops reruns a random handoff play from scratch to ensure docs stay fresh.
- **Escalation simulations**: similar to chaos engineering; we intentionally break a handoff and watch how ops responds, then adjust the packet.

## What stuck with me

- A solid handoff needs storytelling; cold documents flop.
- Operations must show up in discovery, not only at the finish line.
- Ownership becomes real when dashboards, alerts, and scripts are handed over—not when a PM says “it’s done.”

## What I'm building next

I'm writing a reusable template for any squad plus a Linear workflow that enforces the five questions before you can mark an experiment “done.” Want to pilot it? leave me your email.

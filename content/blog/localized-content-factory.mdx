# Localized Content Factory Without Losing Voice

> We graduated from improvised translations to a regional editorial line.

## Context

Marketing wanted to launch in three new markets fast. I built a content factory where AI drafts, humans review and regional guidelines keep us honest.

## Stack I leaned on

- Notion CMS with content IDs
- OpenAI + custom glossaries
- Lokalise for regional reviewers
- Resend to send proofs to stakeholders

## Playbook

1. Defined voice guidelines per region and turned them into prompts.
2. Automated first-pass translation and queued human review with SLAs.
3. Built SEO + legal checklists for every market.
4. Published dashboards for throughput and quality.
5. Stored terminology in versioned glossaries.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Localization time: 10 days → 2.5 days
- Tone errors: -70%
- CTR on localized campaigns: +23%

## What stuck with me

- AI accelerates, but local reviewers remain non-negotiable.
- Without living glossaries every person invents new terms.

## What I'm building next

I'm working on a Figma + Notion plugin so design sees localized copy in context. Interested? let's chat.

# Guardrails for a Marketing CMS in Production

> I love when marketing edits without fear because I know the site is protected.

## Context

Marketing asked for full autonomy but I refused to babysit releases. I built guardrails for Sanity/Contentful and Next.js.

## Stack I leaned on

- Sanity Studio with granular permissions
- Next.js preview mode + Vercel
- Playwright for visual QA
- Resend notifications on publish

## Playbook

1. Defined roles and approval workflows directly in the CMS.
2. Implemented pixel-perfect previews wired to Slack approvals.
3. Added SEO, accessibility and broken-link validators inside the editor.
4. Ran end-to-end tests before publishing critical pages.
5. Published a marketing handbook with best practices and no-gos.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Incidents caused by content changes: 0
- Time to launch campaigns: -50%
- Marketing satisfaction: 9.4/10

## What stuck with me

- Previews must be identical to prod; 'close enough' is not enough.
- The CMS should educate with clear messages when something breaks.

## What I'm building next

Next I'll add AI-powered SEO suggestions in real time. Want a demo? send me a note.

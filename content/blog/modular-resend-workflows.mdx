# Modular Workflows with Resend and React Email

> My email programs are modular—swapping content blocks no longer breaks the pipeline.

## Context

Marketing needed consistent emails without copying HTML. I built a component library with React Email and orchestrated everything through n8n.

## Stack I leaned on

- Resend + React Email component library
- Storybook to preview templates
- Mailosaur for automated QA
- n8n orchestrations

## Playbook

1. Designed hero/metrics/CTA components and published them as a private npm package.
2. Wrote visual + accessibility tests directly in Storybook.
3. Composed workflows in n8n by mixing those components as blocks.
4. Ran QA across real inboxes and stored snapshots for audits.
5. Instrumented telemetry to compare component performance.

## Metrics & telemetry

- CTR up 38% on average
- Time to launch a new sequence: 2 days → 4 hours
- Manual QA bugs: -80%

## What stuck with me

- Separating copy from layout is the fastest productivity boost.
- Email components deserve semantic versioning like any other UI kit.

## What I'm building next

I'm packaging these components into a public repo. Want the link once it's ready? send me a DM.

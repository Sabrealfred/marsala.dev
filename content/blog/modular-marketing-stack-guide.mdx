# How I Orchestrated a Modular Marketing Stack in 2025

> We needed to ship new modules every week, so I built a stack that behaves like LEGO, not concrete.

## Context

I'm a lead dev obsessed with living systems. After shipping three failed launches on monolithic suites I swore every module had to talk to my warehouse and be swappable with a pull request.

## Stack I leaned on

- Next.js 15 + Turborepo for every public surface
- Supabase + BigQuery as the source of truth
- Resend + PostHog for engagement and telemetry
- n8n and Segment as the connective tissue

## Playbook

1. Mapped every funnel stage and paired it with an owning module plus a data contract.
2. Versioned all schemas in Git with dbt tests and reversible Airbyte ELT jobs.
3. Tagged UI components with shared tokens and published a multi-brand Storybook.
4. Committed to weekly releases using feature flags and PostHog experiments.
5. Wrote swap runbooks so replacing CRM, CMS or email is just another PR.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Lead-to-SQL up 34% after unifying enrichment
- Core Web Vitals stayed green across four simultaneous experiences
- Time to onboard a new module: 2.5 days

## What stuck with me

- Data contracts matter more than pretty components; versioning them saved me from three regressions.
- Without demos, retros and alert rituals, modularity devolves into tribal chaos.

## What I'm building next

I'm prototyping an AI copilot module that reads telemetry and proposes experiments automatically. Want it in your stack? ping me.

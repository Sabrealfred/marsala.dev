# Why I Only Push Headless When It Hurts (and Pays)

> I'm not dogmatic—I only push headless when it accelerates experiments and kills toxic fees.

## Context

I've guided three migrations where Shopify exhausted its runway. This piece shares my mental checklists and how I defend the investment to finance.

## Stack I leaned on

- Next.js 15 + edge runtime
- Sanity + Portable Text
- Medusa.js or Shopify Storefront API
- Vercel + Netlify hybrid deploy

## Playbook

1. Start with performance, content and governance audit to ensure it's worth it.
2. Lay out incremental roadmap (frontend, CMS, backend) with feature flags and dark launches.
3. Version the design system in Figma + Storybook before touching production.
4. Integrate analytics and SEO from day zero to avoid losing ranking.
5. Plan module-level rollback runbooks so no one pulls all-nighters.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Lighthouse score: 42 → 96
- Platform fees: $60k → $2.4k per year
- Deploy time: 2 weeks → 5 minutes

## What stuck with me

- Headless without content ownership is a ticking bomb; I train editors and build playgrounds.
- SEO cannot be an afterthought; migrations include URLs and redirects in every sprint.

## What I'm building next

I'm iterating on a headless commerce kit optimized for LATAM. Want to be a beta partner? reach out.

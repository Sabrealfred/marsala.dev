# Growth Sprints in 30 Days to Launch Marsala OS

> I don't ship endless projects; I prefer intense 30-day sprints with real deliverables.

## Context

WhenI lead a Marsala OS implementation I need momentum. This sprint lets me deliver value every week while keeping the whole crew aligned.

## Stack I leaned on

- Linear + Notion for planning
- Figma + Storybook for assets
- Next.js + Supabase for experience
- Resend + n8n for forms and nurtures

## Playbook

1. Week 1: workshops, current system map and prioritized backlog.
2. Week 2: foundations (brand kit, data layer, environments).
3. Week 3: core experiences (modules, research, contact).
4. Week 4: cross-team QA, partial deploy and retro.
5. Post sprint: 60-day backlog with owners.

## Metrics & telemetry

- Time to first real lead: ≤48h post go-live
- Internal satisfaction: ≥8/10
- Reusable modules activated: ≥70%

## What stuck with me

- Every week ends with a demo; without visibility the energy dies.
- Experiments are planned from day one, not after launch.

## What I'm building next

I'm polishing a Linear template so any team can run this sprint. Want it? DM me.
